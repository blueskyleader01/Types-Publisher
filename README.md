## Commandline arguments

### `--skipPublish`

Passing `--skipPublish` causes the `npm publish` step to be skipped.
Version numbers in `version.json` are subsequently not changed.

This is useful for debugging purposes.

### `--forceUpdate`

Passing `--forceUpdate` causes all version checks to be treated as "needs update".
Additionally, version numbers are incremented by 2 instead of by 1 (to handle
the error situations where a package was updated, but versions.json was unchanged).

You can combine `--skipPublish` and `--forceUpdate` to generate a complete set of packages
  on disk for testing purposes.
